# 🧠 Real-Time Face Emotion Detection

A computer vision application that detects and classifies human facial emotions in real-time using your laptop's webcam.

## ✅ Project Status
🎯 Fully Functional — Predicts facial emotions live from webcam feed.

## 🔍 Features
- Real-time face detection using OpenCV
- Emotion classification using trained CNN model
- Predicts: 😄 Happy, 😞 Sad, 😠 Angry, 😲 Surprise, 😐 Neutral
- Works directly from laptop camera
- Trained on the FER-2013 dataset

## 🖥️ How It Works
1. Launch the app
2. Webcam opens automatically
3. Detected face is highlighted
4. Current emotion label is displayed on screen
